# 🔥 YaT — Yet Another Template

YaT enables you to develop your pipeline using the same building blocks on every platform.

Use YaT for your private open-source project on GitHub or your enterprise project on a Jenkins server. YaT is an open source project and will help you or your company deliver your product faster.

With YaT, you can choose to use individual components or the entire package. It's a opinionated approach to building your pipeline, but it will free up more time for developing your product.

With the help of the `yat` commandline interface and `docker` you can execute the components even locally.
